# DP-200 Azure Data Solution - Implementation
Couple of remarks about course and training of Azure Data Solitions

## Exam
- Not the easiest one, but not so difficult if you compare it to AZ-300 even to AZ-103
- Broad range of technologies is covered in some depth
- No virtual labs :-(  
- Databricks - spin up cluster, working with notebook, connecting to data, basic libraries, Spark, Python
- 

## Recommended preparation for exam
- Practice, practice, practice
- Exam does not have any labs, but if you will play with technology around, you will get most of the answers for the questions on the exam.
